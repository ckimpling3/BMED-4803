    "Temporal and rate coding both refer to how information is interpreted by post-synaptic neurons, but the information interpreted is different. For temporal coding, the information encoded is the time neurons fire or a particular pattern in which they fire. For rate coding, the information in coded is the amount of action potentials fired during a particular period. Latency and synchronous coding both refer to times of neuron firing. Latency is the delay of firing while synchronous coding is the firing of multiple neurons at once. Latency refers to one neuron while synchorous is only relevant in the context of a group. Tuning curves are population code and tuning curves are both represenatations of neuron firing patterns; however, tuning curves lack the noise, or extra firing caused by external stimuli, that population codes have. \n",
